Rigidity
========

Rigidity is a simple wrapper to Python's built-in `csv` module that allows for validation and correction of data being read/written to/from CSV files.

This module allows you to easily construct validation and correction rulesets to be applied automatically while preserving the `csv` interface. In other words, you can easily upgrade old code to better adhere to new output styles, or allow new code to better parse old files.
