'''
Rigidity is a simple wrapper to the built-in csv module that allows for
validation and correction of data being read/written from/to CSV files.

This module allows you to easily construct validation and correction
rulesets to be applied automatically while preserving the csv interface.
This allows you to easily upgrade old software to use new, strict rules.

          been verified. Do not depend on the presence or absence of any
