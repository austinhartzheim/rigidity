'''
Rigidity is a simple wrapper to the built-in csv module that allows for
validation and correction of data being read/written from/to CSV files.

This module allows you to easily construct validation and correction
rulesets to be applied automatically while preserving the csv interface.
This allows you to easily upgrade old software to use new, strict rules.

          choose to only conduct the write operation after all rows have
          een verified. Do not depend on the presense or absense of any
