Rigidity Documentation
======================
Rigidity is a simple wrapper to Python's built-in csv module that allows for validation and correction of data being read/written to/from CSV files.

With Rigidity, you can easily construct validation and correction rulesets to be applied automatically while preserving the csv interface. In other words, you can easily upgrade old code to better adhere to new output styles, or allow new code to better parse old files.
